console.log("Hello World")


// It'll give us a designed output if we run it in browser
// console.log("%cHello, World", "color: blue; font-size: 40px");
/*
If you add the %c right after the " character, you can then style the console output by adding the , character after the second ", and then, inside another pair of " and " characters, use valid CSS code to style the words you want to output in the console.
