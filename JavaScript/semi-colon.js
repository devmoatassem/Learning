The semi-colon in JavaScript
-In the English language, the fullstop or period - the . character - is used to separate thoughts into sentences.

-By clearly separating thoughts with the fullstop, you avoid being misunderstood.

-In JavaScript, the semi-colon - the ; character - has a similar purpose: it is used to clearly delimit parts of the code from some other parts of the code.

Automatic Semi-Colon Insertion (ASI)
-Interestingly, the browser has a feature known as "Automatic Semi-colon Insertion" - meaning, it does a pretty good job of "filling in the blanks" in case there is a missing semi-colon where there should be one.

-Effectively, what that means for developers is that most of the time, it makes no difference if a semi-colon is added or not, since the browser is likely to figure it out anyway.

-That's why some developers say that you shouldn't bother with adding semi-colons at all.

-However, other developers argue that it's better to use it wherever it's needed - for the sake of clarity.

-The truth is that most of the time, you can think of adding semi-colons in JavaScript as optional - and somewhat of a stylistic preference.
