// OOP Principles: Encapsulation
// making a code implementation "hidden" from other users, 
// in the sense that they don't have to know how my code 
// works in order to "consume" the code.


// Example
"abc".toUpperCase();

// I don't really need to worry or even waste time thinking about how the toUpperCase() method works.
